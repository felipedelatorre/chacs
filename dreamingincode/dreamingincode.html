                                    <li>Good programers can write code. Great programers know how to rewrite and reuse pre-existing code. No programer wants to write code from scratch if they can grab something that is already written and adapt to its new end</li>

                                    <li>The cathedral is carefully created by a relatively small number of individuals. The bazzar is more of a large community with open ideas and collaboration from many</li>

                                    <li>No, but it can be seen as an alternative where time is less important because the work is cooperation rather than coorporate, the workers are volunteeres, and the motivation is fun and ego, not financial reward </li>
