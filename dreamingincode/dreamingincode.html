                                    <li>Source code is human written. .exe file is binary unreadable by most humans. it is the output of a compiler. The compiler takes lines of codes and turns them into computer lengauage, 0's and 1's.</li>

                                    <li>Good programers can write code. Great programers know how to rewrite and reuse pre-existing code. No programer wants to write code from scratch if they can grab something that is already written and adapt to its new end</li>

                                    <li>The cathedral is carefully created by a relatively small number of individuals. The bazzar is more of a large community with open ideas and collaboration from many</li>

                                    <li>No, but it can be seen as an alternative where time is less important because the work is cooperation rather than coorporate, the workers are volunteeres, and the motivation is fun and ego, not financial reward </li>

                                    <li>Because you almost certainly won't get it right the first time. All you can control is whether you actually plan to get it wrong, or rashly "promise to deliver a throwaway to customers"</li>

                            <li>What do “front ends” and “back ends” mean to software developers?</li>

                                    <li>Front end: "You, the user, are in the front, and the front end is the part of the program that deals with you - that offers windows and dialogues and mouse pointers, tells you what's happening, and provides ways for you to input and out putinformation.</li>
                                    <li>Back end: "The back end is where the results of the front-end events and inputs go so that the computer can make sense of them, save them, and retrieve them.</li>
                                </ul>
                            <li>What did the Lego Hypothesis refer to?</li>

                                    <li>That in the future, code will be built as resuable parts. Easy to grab code and add it to a project. Being able to grab a piece from the shelf, snap them together and presto - working software, with no painful coding!</li>

                                    <li>Because code can be much more complex than the lego brick analogy. A more suited anology would be that these bricks are as if some Lego bricks were half inch long and others half a mile long. Some bricks were made different materials. They also said that the only constant was that nothing was constant.</li>

                                    <li>You cant have something that is Fast, Cheap, and Good. So the trade off are: You can have soemthing that is fast and cheap but it wont be good. You can have something fast and good but it wont be cheap, and the last option is you can have something that is cheap and good it will take time to developed.</li>

                                <li>The Joel Test is a sort of quick-and-dirty set of principles, based on his own experience and 'collective wisdom' to judge whether a development organization has its act together. MS would always run everything at 100%. That is why some upates would take longer ot get release. But once release the number of bugs was significantly less.</li>

                            <li>Chapter 10 is about the notion of “Software Engineering” and the difficulty of applying this label to the development of software. The author suggests that Yertle the Turtle provides an important lesson for programmers. Describe it.</li>

They are, to use a word that is very popular among the software world's malcontents, brittle. When stressed, they do not bend, they break.</li>
