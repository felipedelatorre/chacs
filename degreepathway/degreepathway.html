                <div class="small-9 cell">I am currently taking CS 160 to learn about programming. The course has been challenged me quite a bit primarly because of time management. It very much feels like I am managing a project and I only have x amount of time to work and improve on one project before  I have to move to the next thing. I also took advantage of some community education classes offered at COCC that very much relate to programming in one or other way.

                    <div class="small-9 cell">I honestly feel like I bit more than I could chew for Fall term. I felt preassure and my time trying to lear it all was to optimized. For Winter term I plan on taking CS 161 and I also purchased some classes from Udemy that I would like to go through. In addition, there are a few things that I do at work that are kinda repetetive so my goal would be to learn more about python and learn to how automate them.

What I want are hard skills, programming skills, to get a job without having to go through college. The reason why I am taking credit classes is because I want to learn the material and the classes are so inexpesive to me as an employee of the COCC.

                        <div class="small-9 cell">I have given graduate college a lot of thought however I would like to wait a little more. Maybe after I get my bachelors in computer science, if I ever decide to get it. I would really like to go to Stanford for a joint CS and MBA degree. But with such a low acceptance rate I might need to come up with an alternative.
